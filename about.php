                <div class="main-text-p">
                    I write code, develop games, and create websites. I learned programming in order to make a game for Android, 
                    and it just made sense. 
                    Every interest I ever had, including music, languages, math, philosophy, psychology, and theology,
                    seemed to come together in software development. 
                    <br><br>
                    There was the logical and linguistic side of the art, which 
                    involved translating ideas into code.
                    <br><br>
                    Then there was the mathematics involved in designing game physics, analysis of algorithm performance, and procedural
                    graphics using geometry.
                    <br><br>
                    The musical and philosophical side comes alive in the design and architecture of the software. This is the most
                    abstract side of software development, and it deals with how to represent and process data, how to structure the program
                    flow for maximum performance given the system limitations, and how to build something tangible out of intagible pieces.
                    <br><br>
                    Then there's the human component. A human will interact with the software in some way, and that means that human psychology
                    must be taken into consideration when designing the human-facing components.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, there's the limitlessness of software. Any idea can come to life, and anything can be improved. There is no
                    knowing the future, but there is a way to be involved in its development.

                    I used icons from the Noun Project for this site. I modified all of them by adding colors to the png versions.
                    1. Cloud by Ilaria Bernareggi from the Noun Project — Modified by adding white color to the cloud.
                    2. Clouds by Ilaria Bernareggi from the Noun Project — Modified by adding white color to the clouds.
                    3. Heart by Raji Purcell from the Noun Project — The full version was modified by adding color.
                    <br><br>
                    4. Heart by Raji Purcell from the Noun Project — The empty version was modified by adding color.
                    5. Sword by Bluetip Design from the Noun Project — Color and shade was added to the blade 
                    6. Shield by Bluetip Design from the Noun Project — Bronze coloring was added to the shield
                    <br><br>
                    7. Coffee by Haik Dettmann from the Noun Project — White coloring was added to the coffee mug
                    8. Mushroom by Haik Dettmann from the Noun Project — Coloring added to the mushroom
